# `snip_copy`

`snip_copy` creates copies of a file, snipping away portions of the original.  Our motivation is to allow instructors to manage one file which contains a "complete assignment" (e.g. including rubric for TAs & solutions) and use `snip_copy` to automatically create a solution and student copy of the same assignment.  See [our example](test/ex_hw) for one such use case.
